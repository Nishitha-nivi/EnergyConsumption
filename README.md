# **Energy Consumption Trend Analysis with Power BI**

## **Overview**
The **Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI** program equips learners with in-demand skills in **data pre-processing, visualization, and analysis** using Power BI. 

In this project, we:
- Connect Power BI to multiple data sources.
- Process and transform data for analysis.
- Build **interactive visualizations** to uncover energy consumption trends.
- Employ best **design practices** for reporting.
- Draw insights to support **data-driven decision-making** for businesses.

## **Data Analysis Process**
### **1️⃣ Data Collection and Import**
- Gather data from various sources (Excel, CSV, databases).
- Use **"Get Data"** in Power BI to import data.

### **2️⃣ Data Transformation & Cleaning**
- Utilize **Power Query Editor** for filtering, merging, renaming columns, and handling missing values.

### **3️⃣ Data Modeling**
- Define **relationships between tables** using primary and foreign keys.

### **4️⃣ Data Visualization**
- Create charts, tables, maps, and KPIs to **track energy consumption trends**.

### **5️⃣ Data Analysis & Calculation**
- Use **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to create calculated columns and measures.

### **6️⃣ Dashboard Creation**
- Assemble visualizations into an interactive dashboard.
- Add slicers and filters for better user interaction.

### **7️⃣ Interactivity & Reporting**
- Implement drill-through actions, cross-filtering, and tooltips.
- Export insights for decision-makers.
